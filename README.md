# Weather-Prediction
The EDA perform in this Dataset by using Jupyter Notebook. 

PROBLEM STATMENT:- Using machine learning concepts, need to predict the weather condition.The weather condition may be drizzle,rain,sun,snow,fog. This weather condition are decided by year and month.

Description:- The Weather Dataset is a information about the weather condition of Month. It records precipitation, maximum temperature, miniimum temperature, Wind speed. This Dataset available as a csv file. We are going to analyze this dataset using Panda's data frame.

#About Dataset:

Using the Columns :

precipitation

tempmax

tempmin

wind

#OBJECTIVE:-
We are going to predict the weather condition :

drizzle

rain

sun

snow

fog
1.Importing the Essential Libraries

2.Loading the Data using CSV file

3.Checking for missing or nan values

4.Get the count of missing values in each column of a dataframe.

DATA VISUALISATION:-
For data visualisation we use MATPLOTLIB & SEABORN libraries.

MATPLOTLIB:-
Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays.
Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.
SEABORN:-
Seaborn is an amazing visualization library for statistical graphics plotting in Python.
It provides beautiful
